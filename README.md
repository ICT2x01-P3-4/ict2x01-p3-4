## Development Workflow
### Default branches  

`master`: Only codes that are ready to deploy will be merged here.  

`dev`: This is where codes are being developed.

### Note
Any development **MUST** be done in the `feature` branches first before merging to the `dev` branch. Merging to `master` branch will only be done when all codes are ready to deploy.

### Feature Branches
1. All new feature branches should be created in the `dev` branch.
2. Follow this naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>`.

### Development Branch
1. Only **COMPLETED** feature branches can be merged into the `dev` branch.
2. Pull Requests (PR) should be created before any merging takes place.
3. The rest of the team members should be assigned as a reviewer for the PR.
4. PRs should be approved by **AT LEAST ONE** team member before merging.

### Master Branch
1. Only **COMPLETED AND DEPLOYABLE** codes from `dev` branch should be merged into the `master` branch.
2. PRs should be created before any merging takes place.
3. PRs should be created by the **Team Lead** and all team members should be assigned as a reviewer.
4. PRs should be approved by **ALL** team members before merging.
### Workflow
1. Create a feature branch by branching off the `dev` branch.
```
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name> dev
```
2. Push the new feature branch to the remote repository.
```
git push -u origin feature/<feature-name>
```
3. Save the progress
```
# Add all files to staging area
git add .

# Double check if everything added is correct
git status

# Commit the changes
# Commit messages should be in imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug"
git commit -m "<commit message>"

# Push changes to the corresponding branch in the remote repository
git push
```
4. Create a new pull request to merge the completed feature into the `dev` branch. **MAKE SURE `dev` IS SELECTED AS `base`!**
5. The reviewer will then merge the PR into the `dev` branch once all code quality and conventions are satisfied.
